How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-Going through this process with a pair was useful in that we were able to check in with each other about the necessity of elements (ie: does this need a table now? nope!). Also very useful to have two brains for error-checking and looking up what tags do.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-At our current level, I do not feel it is very useful, as it is easy to envision how a page will look from the code I develop for it. However, I do see how this will quickly become useful as a base skeletal reference when I start adding style elements and more complicated layouts.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
-For this exercise, we decided to keep it as simple as possible, to respect both our current knowledge level and the time limit for the exercise. We had just 4 boxes, all in a column: page title, a navigation bar, the article text, and a footer with contact info.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
-I did not learn about any semantic elements for this exercise, but I did learn some structural ones:
<nav> for the navigation bar section
  <footer> for the contact info at the bottom
    <article> for the main body
