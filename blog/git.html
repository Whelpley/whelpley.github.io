      <h2>Salutations, First Thoughts</h2>
      <h4>Covering matters of Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h4>
      <h6>October 4, 2015</h6>

      <p>Hello! My name is Michael Whelpley, I am a student at Dev Bootcamp, and this is my technical blog. In this blog I will be writing on the topics I have learned about in the past week - as such, the subject matter will be intitially be at an introductory level. For my first entry, I will be covering Version Control: its benefits, how the software Git helps you to keep track of changes, and why GitHub is useful for storing your code.</p>
      <p>Version control software is useful for document creation because it enables users to save the state of a creative project at multiple points in time (as selected by the user with "commits"). If a user wishes to return to previous state of the project, it's as easy as jumping back to the closest commit. Version control is especially useful to those who work in teams on a single work, as it enables the changes made by multiple contributors to be separately tracked, and later the individual changes may be jointly merged into the main body of work.</p>
      <p>Git helps you keep track of your changes by allowing you to make a separate thread of work, called a "branch", in which you may save your work at chosen save points (the "commit" mentioned earlier). With each commit, you may attach a message that shows any who will review your work what changes have been made.  When the work in your branch is deemed worthy, it may then be merged into the main body of work, and the branch it was created on may then be deleted to tidy up your project threads.</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading, and I hope you will return for next week's installment!</p>
