    <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
    <h4>What's the difference?</h4>
    <h6>October 25, 2015</h6>

    <p>Welcome back! Today's blog will cover Arrays and Hashes, with  respect to the Ruby programming language. I will try to keep the description acessible to those not schooled in programming, though I will also include code examples as a demonstration.</p>
    <p>Arrays and Hashes are two means of storing collections of data. Both enable the data to be sorted and otherwise operated on, but they also have a few key differences.</p>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>To envision an array, think of a row of buckets. Each bucket can contain any other thing, and each one is labeled by its order in the row. When you load up the buckets with the data you are trying to store, each item gets placed in its own bucket, in sequential numerical order (unless otherwise specified), starting with slot "0" and going up. When you want to later access the contents of a bucket, you tell the array-conveyor to bring you a particular bucket via its index number.</p>
    <p>I will demonstrate a few Ruby-specific things about Arrays in the code examples below:</p>

    <div class="snippet">
      <h3>Array Examples </h3>
      <h5>Here I am declaring a new array, with 3 slots. Note how each slot has a different type of data (integer, float, string). That's OK!</h5>
      <code>new_array = [45, -3564.043, "walking dogs"]</code>
      <h5>Having declared the new_array, I can call it like so below to return the value "walking dogs". (Remember that the array index starts at [0], so the third slot will be [2]:</h5>
      <code>
        new_array[2]<br>
        # returns the string "walking dogs"
      </code>
      <h5>There are many methods you can call to manipulate the contents of an array; one simple example is "reverse", which reverses the order of the array:</h5>
      <code>
        new_array.reverse!<br>
        new_array[2]<br>
        # returns the integer 45
      </code>

    </div>

    <h3>Hashes</h3>
    <p>A hash, on the other hand, is often analogized to a dictionary. Every hash consists of a collection of pairs of objects, called a "key" and a "value". The key is like the word which the dictionary is sorted by, and the value is like the definition of that word. So, rather than accessing a value by its numerical order amongst other data, you can just remember the name of the key, and you can access that data associated with that key. Most importantly, a hash can only have one of any type of key, but multiple keys may point to the same value.</p>
    <p>As before, I will demonstrate a few Ruby-specific things about Hashes in the code examples below:</p>

    <div class="snippet">
      <h3>Hash Snippet </h3>
      <h5>Here is one way you can create an hash, using what is called Literal Construction. Each key and value gets specifically indicated, with the key on the left column and the value to the right of the => symbol:</h5>
      <code>
        new_hash = {<br>
        "name" => "Michael",<br>
        "state" => "CA",<br>
        "signature move" => "The Windmill",<br>
      }
      </code>
      <h5>To access the contents of an hash, you call its key, rather than the index number. (There are ways to do the latter in recent versions of Ruby, however.)</h5>
      <code>
        new_hash["state"]<br>
        # returns the string "CA"
      </code>
      <h5>As with arrays, you can call methods on the hash to manipulate it. Here, we will employ "value?", which returns "true" if the hash contains the specified value.</h5>
      <code>
        new_hash.value?("The Windmill")<br>
        # returns True
      </code>
    </div>

    <p>Aside from this basic structural difference, there are some features which can make one or the other more desirable to use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An array is preferable when you have a set of one type of data, while a hash makes more sense for pieces of data that are paired.</li>
      <li>Arrays are easier to access and sort by insertion order.</li>
      <li>If you wish to combine data sets, arrays are much easier to put together. With hashes, you run the risk of merging overlapping keys, which may result in data loss.</li>
      <li>For reasons not yet understood by me, hashes are quicker to access, which can improve the speed of processes using them over arrays.
    </ul>

    <p>I recognize that I have only touched the surface of these topics, and one can go much further in depth here. Nevertheless, I hope you learned something, and that you will come back around next week!</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-Going through this process with a pair was useful in that we were able to check in with each other about the necessity of elements (ie: does this need a table now? nope!). Also very useful to have two brains for error-checking and looking up what tags do.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-At our current level, I do not feel it is very useful, as it is easy to envision how a page will look from the code I develop for it. However, I do see how this will quickly become useful as a base skeletal reference when I start adding style elements and more complicated layouts.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
-For this exercise, we decided to keep it as simple as possible, to respect both our current knowledge level and the time limit for the exercise. We had just 4 boxes, all in a column: page title, a navigation bar, the article text, and a footer with contact info.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
-I did not learn about any semantic elements for this exercise, but I did learn some structural ones:
<nav> for the navigation bar section
  <footer> for the contact info at the bottom
    <article> for the main body
