    <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
    <h4>What's the difference?</h4>
    <h6>October 25, 2015</h6>

    <p>Today's blog will cover Arrays and Hashes (with resepect to the Ruby programming language).</p>
    <p>Two means of storing collections of data.</p>
    <p>To envision an array, think of a row of buckets. Each bucket can contain any other thing, and each one is labeled by its order in the row. </p>

    <div class="snippet">

      <h5>explaining what this code is</h5>
      <code>The actual hacking goes here. It will be formatted to look all cool in CSS, you don't style in HTML no more.</code>
    </div>

    <p>A hash, on the other hand, is often analogized to a dictionary. Every hash consists of a collection of pairs of objects, called a "key" and a "value". While the value may be any other object, the key may only be a ____ or ____. This is useful when you wish to store [single row vs associated pairs]</p>

    </div>

    <p>Aside from this basic structural difference, there are some features which can make one or the other more desirable to use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Faster?</li>
      <li>Array: easier to access by insertion order.</li>
      <li>Faster?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Conclusion, and thanks for reading. Come back around next week!.</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-Going through this process with a pair was useful in that we were able to check in with each other about the necessity of elements (ie: does this need a table now? nope!). Also very useful to have two brains for error-checking and looking up what tags do.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-At our current level, I do not feel it is very useful, as it is easy to envision how a page will look from the code I develop for it. However, I do see how this will quickly become useful as a base skeletal reference when I start adding style elements and more complicated layouts.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
-For this exercise, we decided to keep it as simple as possible, to respect both our current knowledge level and the time limit for the exercise. We had just 4 boxes, all in a column: page title, a navigation bar, the article text, and a footer with contact info.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
-I did not learn about any semantic elements for this exercise, but I did learn some structural ones:
<nav> for the navigation bar section
  <footer> for the contact info at the bottom
    <article> for the main body
