Reflection questions:

What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

-This challenge refinfored the lessons of the previous exercises - by applying different padding, border, and margin settings to the elements of my page, and adjusting them in Devtools, I was able to get a better sense of how small adjustments in each affected the page as a whole.


What did you learn about CSS positioning?

-I learned that you need to be very careful about applying a position property to an element: with the large variation of browser windows available, it is often preferable to keep the default "static" setting to keep elements from jumbling over one another. However, I did implement a float:right on an image in the main box of my index page, once I confirmed that text will wrap around that image.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

-I found it straightforward to apply text and font decoration to the pages, and was severely challenged my getting the positioning right (in the end, settling on mostly static positioning). Color selection was a moderate challenge, but that was sped along after some browsing of user-generated palettes in Kuler.


What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

-Aside from reinforcing the CSS learned in earlier challenges, I also learned a new trick in my research  - the :first-of-type selector, which chooses the first of its selctor type from its parent class, is good for styling the first letter of blog entries.
