      <h2>A short biography </h2>
      <p>I grew up in the great state of New Jersey, youngest of eight children. My parents worked hard and were able to send me to <a href="https://www.delbarton.org/">Delbarton</a>, a fine institution of learning. Aside attaining a solid base of Western education, I began developing my somatic skills in soccer, kung fu, juggling, and cross-country running.</p>
      <p>From there, I was able to secure an admission to <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/">Princeton University</a>, where I studied Electrical Engineering, making my first deep dive into technical studies. Along the way, I learned capoeira & <a href="http://sympoh.mycpanel.princeton.edu/">break-dancing</a>, hosted a weekly show on <a href="http://wprb.com/">WPRB</a>, and wrote, edited, & planed pranks for the venerable <a href="http://www.tigermag.com/">Tiger Magazine</a>.</p>
      <p>Following graduation, I initially pursued a career in intellectual property law, first doing research for a local attorney, then moving to Virginia to put in a year examining invention applications at the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a>.</p>
      <p>It turned out that the IP field was not quite my cup of tea, so after my time there I decided take a radical turn with my career: I moved to San Francisco, and spent a decade working in the culinary field.</p>
      <p>As those ten years rounded up, I decided to make another major life change, and re-embrace the tech world. I chose to enter the <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> program because it looked to be an excellent way to bring me back up to speed with the current state of web technology.</p>
      <p>Dev Bootcamp is putting my brain through the wringer, but each week I feel a little stronger. Sometimes, I play "Eye of the Tiger" in my head and imagine this all as a movie training montage. It helps, don't judge.</p>
